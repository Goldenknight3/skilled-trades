            <p> An Industrial Mechanic Millwright is responsable for maintaining and fixing factory machines.
                They must know all sorts of different mechanisms, including pneumatics, hydraulics, electric motors,
            combustion engines, gearboxes, and more.  They need to know the basics of machining their own parts, using various tools.

            <p> 
                Industrial Mechanic Millwrights are responsable for the repair, maintenance and checkups for the machinery used in factories.
                They have the very important job of enusuring that all the machines in a factory run smoothly. If there is a breakdown, they will be called
                first. They are also expected to mill their own parts, because factories cannot wait weeks for a part to arrive.

            <p> 
                Industrial Mechanic Millwrights often work around 40 hours per week. Sometimes, they need to work on call in order to restore
                machine breakdowns.Sometimes mechanics need to move to remote locations.<br>
                Since they need to work in factories to repair equipment, they work in noisy, dirty enviroments. Sometimes work must be done
                outdoors, exposing them to potentially bad weather.<br>
                Factories also can have many dangers to them, like falling objects and very powerful moving parts. This is why industrial mechanics need
                to be extensivley trained in safety.

                            <li>It is very easiy to start earning as a millwright. Upon completing grade twelve, you can sign up for the 
                                aprenticeship program, and after two years, you will be earning $79,000 per year.</li>

                            <li>You do not even need to complete the official aprenticeship program. Becoming an Inudstrial Mechanic Millwrights is a free trade,
                                meaning that you can get educated anywhere. So even if the aprenticeship program is not available for whatever reason, you can still
                            get a job via other kinds of education. </li>

                                Noisy machinery can also be detrimental to your mental health/the physical health of your ears.

                I think if I don't get into any univeristies, then I will honestly consider this job, at least to survive. Considering I could 
                start making a very nice wage for only two years of extra education, I could work for a little bit before trying to return to university.
